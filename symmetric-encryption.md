# Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is a two-way process that uses the same key for encryption and decryption.

Extremely secure

Relatively fast

Problems: Must share the key

Good for encryting your own data

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)

Developed in the early 1970's by IBM

Encrypted using a 56 bit symmetric key

Key is typically 64 bits, but only the first 56 bits are used

The cipher text is the same size as the plain text

## Triple DES

Apply DES three times with two or three different keys
