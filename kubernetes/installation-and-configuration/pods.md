# Pods

One or more containers

The most basic unit of work

Ephemeral - No pod is ever re-used

Atomic - if one of the containers in the pod crashes, the pod is unavailable

Kubernetes keeps pods running in the desired state

State - Up and Running

Health - Is application running in pod

Probes check if the application is healthy
